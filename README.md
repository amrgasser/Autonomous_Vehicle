## This is the base for my self driving car research. The model implemented here is a basic Reinforcement learning network with multiple convolutional layers to detect the street ahead and determine the steering angle using a Probility distribution function with Mean  ```μ ``` and variance ```σ```.

## Curently researching and implementing a better network to incorporate speed control and collision detection.

### Will later include the specifics on all required dependencies and download links for vista_traces.
